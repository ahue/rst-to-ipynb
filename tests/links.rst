A link: `images <images.ipynb>`_

rst2ipynb implements some very crude support for trivial cross
references; the links below will point to `images.ipynb`, allowing at
least to refer to other documents in the same directory without
hardcoding the `.ipynb` extension in the source file.

- :ref:`images`
- :ref:`Les Images <images>`
